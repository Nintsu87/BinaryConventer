# Binary Conventer:
-------------------

03.10.2022:

Last time I added some hex->dec options and made it nicely. I also realized afterwards I need to change the algorythm to endless and I have an idea to make it work.
What I ended up doing: 
- the binary to decimal works way more smoothly and more realistic
- added hex2dec and dec2hex

Starting from basic binary conventer. I'd like to try to get it done with my logic and look up how to improve after I'm done with my shananigans. 
My starting logic is to make the program check, if the input has correct characters (0 or 1) and its lenght not more than 11 characters. I'm thinking of iterating it from back to front with 2 to the power of the current 1's position in the binary. 
  - Seems like it worked and it give me more ideas of maybe making it the other way around (bin->dec) and maybe add hex in this too
  - I should really use python more often, took me awhile to get started after c++s and phps ; at the end of all rows
